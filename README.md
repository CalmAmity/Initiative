<h1>WHAT IS IT?</h1>
<p>This is meant to be a simple initiative tracker, primarily designed for personal use with 5e D&amp;D.</p>
<h1>BUT WHY REINVENT THE WHEEL?</h1>
<p>I tried a number of initiative tracking solutions, but none really fit my wishes. These wishes (and hence, the design principles behind this project) are as follows:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Easy to read - no unnecessary fluff, no legion of buttons you will likely never click.</li>
	<li>Full keyboard interaction - the mouse is for playing first person shooter games; let's keep it that way.</li>
	<li>Quickly adding recurring characters - I don't want to have to type the names of player characters every time they enter combat, and I *definitely* do not want to have to ask them their basic stats again.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also I wanted to brush up on my Swing chops, because that's useful for... something...</p>
<h1>SO ABOUT THOSE KEYBOARD CONTROLS...</h1>
<p>The current controls are as follows:</p>
<table>
	<tr><td>F1</td><td>Add a new item to the tracker.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>F2</td><td>Next turn: move the turn indicator down one item.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Shift+F2</td><td>Previous turn: move the turn indicator up one item.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Enter</td><td>Rearrange: recognise and fill predefined entries, and order the entries based on the initiative values.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Arrow up</td><td>Move keyboard focus up one item.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Arrow down</td><td>Move keyboard focus down one item.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>F4</td><td>Delete the item that currently has keyboard focus.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>They are currently not configurable, and neither are they displayed anywhere in the application's GUI. Both of those things may change in the future, but neither is a high priority for me.</p>
<h1>WHY DOESN'T IT HAVE &lt;INSERT FEATURE&gt;?</h1>
</p>One of three possible answers:<p>
<ul>
	<li>It wouldn't be that useful to me.</li>
	<li>I haven't gotten around to it (do not assume that I ever will, you *will* be disappointed).</li>
	<li>I didn't think of that, that's actually pretty cool and/or useful!</li>
</ul>
<h1>REALLY THOUGH, WITHOUT &lt;INSERT FEATURE&gt; THIS THING IS USELESS TO ME.</h1>
<p>You are welcome to fork this project. Otherwise, the internet has many other approaches available (just as free as this one, and quite probably better documented).</p>
<h1>REAL GMs ONLY USE PEN AND PAPER, YOU ARE INCOMPETENT / A DISGRACE / DOING IT WRONGâ„¢</h1>
<p>Okay.</p>
